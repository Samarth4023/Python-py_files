## About Me

Hi there! I'm Samarth Pujari, building for Ai/ML and a passionate Python enthusiast. I believe that coding is like magic—once you learn the spells (or, you know, functions), you can create wonders! 🌟

## Projects

### 1. Hello, World!

My first Python project was the classic "Hello, World!" program. It felt like opening a secret door to a new universe. Since then, I've been building small projects, experimenting with libraries, and solving puzzles.

### 2. Tic Tac Toe Game

It's on different repo btw, check out !

## Learning Resources

Learning Python is like assembling a puzzle—you collect pieces from various sources. Here are some resources I recommend:

- Python.org: The official Python website.
- Codecademy: Interactive Python course.
- Real Python: Tutorials, articles, and quizzes.
- Stack Overflow: Where I go when I'm stuck (which happens a lot!).
