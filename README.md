# My Python Journey 🐍

Welcome to my Python journey repository! 🚀 
As a beginner, I'm excited to share my progress, learnings, and adventures in the world of Python programming. Whether you're a fellow newbie or an experienced coder, I hope you find something valuable here.

If you want to clone this repo and run it on your local machine using jupyter notebook, then dont't worry your friend has created another repo named as *Python-jupyter_notebook* with same contents as this repo but with .ipynb files so that your learning never stops ;)

## About Me

Hi there! I'm Samarth Pujari, building for Ai/ML and a passionate Python enthusiast. I believe that coding is like magic—once you learn the spells (or, you know, functions), you can create wonders! 🌟

## Projects

### 1. Hello, World!

My first Python project was the classic "Hello, World!" program. It felt like opening a secret door to a new universe. Since then, I've been building small projects, experimenting with libraries, and solving puzzles.

### 2. Tic Tac Toe Game

It's on different repo btw, check out !

## Learning Resources

Learning Python is like assembling a puzzle—you collect pieces from various sources. Here are some resources I recommend:

- Python.org: The official Python website.
- Codecademy: Interactive Python course.
- Real Python: Tutorials, articles, and quizzes.
- Stack Overflow: Where I go when I'm stuck (which happens a lot!).
