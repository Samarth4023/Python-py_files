#Task Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:
# If n is odd, print Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
# If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

    else:
        if 2 <= n <= 5:
            print("Not Weird")
        elif 6 <= n <= 20:
            print("Weird")
        elif n > 20:
            print("Not Weird")
